                        <p>The life cycle of a frog is a quite interesting. As mentioned previously amphibians undergo a metamorphosis, and 
                        frogs showcase this process quite nicely. There are four stages that a frog will undergo to become, well, a frog.
                        Depicted in the photo to the left, a frog will being as an egg, then tadpole, froglet, and itâ€™s final form an Adult Frog. This process 
                        typically occurs in a short time span

                            <p>When a frog egg is laid it will be in a body of water. It is important to know that there will never be a singular 
                                egg as some species of frogs can lay up to 4,000 eggs per birth. The egg will be soft due to its high content of 
                                moisture and also acts as a defense mechanism to defend against any curious predators. In turn the texture of the 
                                egg also acts as nutrients for the embryo, as it allows it to gain nutrients from it.

                            <p>At the beginning of a tadpoles life they will stay closely to aquatic plants and grass; they can not fully migrate to 
                                land since they still require water and can not survive on land at this exact point. The main food source of a tadpole 
                                will contain small vegetation, such as the plants they are residing next to.</p>

                            <p>Tadpoles are actually quite active and are always moving. The gills that have already developed on them allow them to 
                                breath underwater and give them the ability to properly swim.</p>

                            <p>After about 14 weeks more physical changes appear where the frog can then develop their hind legs and a tail. During this 
                                process on the outside, internally their organs such as lungs will being to form. It will take about 14 weeks for the frog 
                                to develop into a proper froglet

                                the nutrients from the tail in the previous stage are being used. Now instead of being confined to the water, the froglet 
                                is able to explore land! This means that their diet also begins to change as they are no longer feeding off of small vegetation. 
                                A sticky tongue forms allowing for bugs and various insects to become an optimal meal choice for these slimy friends.
