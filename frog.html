                    Being an amphibian, frogs can live on land and in water thus expanding there possibilities of locations to call home.

                            reproductive needs. An amphibian can only produce their eggs in or at least near the water. Additionally, 
                            a change in their structure (metamorphosis) proceeds at a point in their life, typically changing them from an 
                            aquatic larvae to an adult with legs and functional lungs</p>

                        Their homes tend to be different as well. As noted, frogs vary in their habitat 
                        where as a toad has a more terrestrial desire. Additionally, there are noticeable physical 
                        differences between the two. A frogs have smooth and hydrated skin, adn long legs. The toad on the
