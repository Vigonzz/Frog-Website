                <p class="about-me"> I say us, its really just one person, and that is me: Violet. In an effort to expand my portfolio I decided to try my best to create one website every two weeks. 
                This specif site would mark the beginning of that journey and took great effort to truly conjure what I wanted it to be about. 
                After careful deliberation I felt as if I could not decide until I figured why not frogs.<br><br>

                Strangely enough, if I was to be asked what my favorite animal I would be confused and perhaps even say I dont have one. However, 
                I am not entirely convinced. You see my favorite colors are yellow and green (like a frog), I have a frog desk mat, frog statue, and 
                adore Kermit the Frog. In a way, I really do like frogs. <br><br>

                I dont think frogs get enough credit, they are fascinating creatures who have had a prominent hand in many things that humans are involved with. 
                Additionally, there are many different types of frogs that exist throughout the world. But back to the point of this website. I wanted something to 
                showcase and, as mentioned, I really like frogs. I want to be able to share frog knowledge in a fun way for others to learn and explore.
